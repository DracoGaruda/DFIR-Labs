## 1. Scenario

On September 28, 2025, the SOC team detected suspicious network activity from an administrator's workstation, including connections to an unknown external IP address and unauthorized security tool modifications. The user reported opening what appeared to be a legitimate document received via email earlier that day, after which their security software was mysteriously disabled.

Initial triage reveals evidence of file creation in unusual locations and system configuration changes, suggesting a multi-stage attack with potential data exfiltration occurring hours after the initial compromise.

You have been provided with a disk triage of the compromised host. Your mission is to reconstruct the complete attack chain, identify all malicious components, and determine the full scope of the compromise

## 2. Summary
*Summary of the incident goes here.*

## 3. Challenge Solutions

### Task 2
**Question:** The malicious JavaScript payload was hosted on a compromised website to facilitate the initial infection. What is the complete domain name that hosted the malicious JS file?

**Answer:** `hotelx.rf.gd`

**Explanation:** Check for the URL for the same record*

### Task 3
**Question:** The JavaScript file created a PowerShell script to advance the attack chain. What is the full directory path where the PowerShell script was created from the JS file?

**Answer:** `C:\Users\Public\Scripts`

**Explanation:** Review the Java script code. You will find code was trying to create a powershell. You can find location of file from the chrome history review

### Task 4
**Question:** The PowerShell script invoked another PowerShell command to download two additional files onto the device and then executed one of them. What are the names of the downloaded files?

**Answer:** `venumentrada.txt, runpe.txt`

**Explanation:** Review the same directory

### Task 5
**Question:** The downloaded files included obfuscated content that needed to be converted to reveal their true nature. What is the actual file type of the second downloaded file?

**Answer:** `EXE`

---

### Task 6
**Question:** The first downloaded file converted the second file to its original format, saved it, and then executed it. What is the name of the executed file that was run after conversion?

**Answer:** `swchost.exe`

**Explanation:** You can find this file in same directory

---

### Task 7
**Question:** The initial JavaScript file employed specific technique to evade security controls and prevent detection. What is the MITRE ATT&CK technique ID for the method used by the JavaScript file?

**Answer:** `T1562.001`

**Explanation:** When you review java script file you find "-Command Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true". This is inline with Impair Defenses (T1562) technique, often through sub-techniques like Disable or Modify Tools (T1562.001)

### Task 9
**Question:** The malicious executable established communication with a C2 server infrastructure. What is the IP address of the C2 server that the malicious executable contacted?

**Answer:** `3.122.239.15`

**Explanation:** Review sysmon event id 3 for network connections. filter for payload with swchost to get ip address
